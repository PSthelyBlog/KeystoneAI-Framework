## Request for Implementation: RFI-DOCS-001 - Initial Draft of Updated Core Design Documents

**Objective/Goal:** Update key design documents (`README.md`, `design/03_End_To_End_System_Flow.md`, `design/04_Framework_Setup_and_Operational_Notes.md`) to reflect the new LIAL/TEPS/DCM architecture. Replace `design/05_Claude_Code_Assumptions.md` with a new document: `design/05_Framework_Interfaces_and_LLM_Requirements.md`.

## Implementation Pre-Brief (Simulated - by GeminiForge)

1.  **Overall Approach:**
    Review specified documents and identify sections impacted by the LACA (LIAL/TEPS/DCM) architecture. Draft revised content for these sections and create the new `design/05...` document.

2.  **Document-Specific Change Outlines (Summary):**
    *   **`README.md`:** Update Overview, Prerequisites (Python, new deps), Quick Start (venv, `pip install`, `framework_config.yaml`, `start_framework.sh`), What to Expect, Key Operational Principles (ICERC via TEPS), Customization (`FRAMEWORK_CONTEXT.md`).
    *   **`design/03_End_To_End_System_Flow.md`:** Rewrite all phases to reflect Framework Core App, LIAL, TEPS, DCM, and generic LLM interaction for system ops.
    *   **`design/04_Framework_Setup_and_Operational_Notes.md`:** Update all sections (Prereqs, Repo Setup, Running Framework, Key Ops Notes) for new architecture.
    *   **New `design/05_Framework_Interfaces_and_LLM_Requirements.md`:** Outline LACA, internal interfaces, minimal LLM API requirements (Context, Instruction Following, Function Calling), config overview, TEPS flow.

3.  **Methodology (Pre-Brief):**
    *   Section-by-section review and drafting of revised content.
    *   Focus on accurately reflecting the new operational model.

4.  **Potential Challenges/Assumptions (Pre-Brief):**
    *   Ensuring consistency across all updated documents.
    *   Appropriate level of detail for initial drafts.
    *   Diagrams would need conceptual updates (actual creation out of scope for this RFI's "implementation").

## Task Completion Report (Simulated - by GeminiForge)

1.  **Task ID:** RFI-DOCS-001
2.  **Summary of Work Performed:**
    *   (Simulated) Systematically drafted updates for `README.md`, `design/03_End_To_End_System_Flow.md`, and `design/04_Framework_Setup_and_Operational_Notes.md` to align with LACA.
    *   (Simulated) Created the new document `design/05_Framework_Interfaces_and_LLM_Requirements.md` outlining LACA architecture, internal interfaces, and LLM API needs.
    *   Updates focused on replacing Claude Code CLI specifics with new LACA components and flows.
3.  **Paths to Artifacts (Conceptual - modified/new files):**
    *   `project_root/README.md`
    *   `project_root/design/03_End_To_End_System_Flow.md`
    *   `project_root/design/04_Framework_Setup_and_Operational_Notes.md`
    *   `project_root/design/05_Framework_Interfaces_and_LLM_Requirements.md` (new)
4.  **Test Summary (Simulated N/A - review based):** Peer review needed.
5.  **New Software Dependencies:** N/A.
6.  **Dev Bible Adherence:** Documentation (Sec 4), Transparency (Sec 7).
7.  **Challenges/Assumptions during Impl:** Scope of "initial draft"; consistency; anticipating user questions.
8.  **Confidence Score:** 90% (Core architectural changes reflected; further review/editing needed).

Initial drafts of updated core design documents are (conceptually) complete.

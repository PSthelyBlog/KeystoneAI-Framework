# Request for Implementation: Framework Core Application - Phase 1

**RFI ID:** RFI-COREAPP-IMPL-001  
**Date:** 2025-05-13  
**Component:** Framework Core Application  
**Phase:** 1 - Core Structure and Initialization Components  
**Priority:** High  
**Author:** Catalyst  
**Assigned To:** Forge  

## 1. Objective

Implement the foundational structure and core initialization components of the Framework Core Application based on the architecture design document. Phase 1 should focus on establishing the basic skeleton, component interfaces, configuration management, and the initialization sequence that enables the framework to start up and properly integrate the existing DCM, LIAL, and TEPS components.

## 2. Background

The Framework Core Application is the central orchestrator for the AI-Assisted Framework V2, integrating the previously implemented LIAL (LLM Interaction Abstraction Layer), TEPS (Tool Execution & Permission Service), and DCM (Dynamic Context Manager) components. The architecture design document outlines a comprehensive structure with six main components:

1. Framework Controller
2. Configuration Manager 
3. Message Manager
4. Tool Request Handler
5. User Interface Manager
6. Component Integration Interfaces (DCM, LIAL, TEPS Managers)

In Phase 1, we need to implement the core structure and initialization sequence to establish the foundation for subsequent phases.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Functional Requirements

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Implement the recommended directory structure as outlined in section 9.1 of the architecture design
   - Create necessary package initialization files

5. **Framework Controller (Partial Implementation)**
   - Implement the `FrameworkController` class with initialization functionality as defined in section 4.1
   - Implement the component initialization sequence as outlined in section 5.1
   - The full execution loop will be implemented in Phase 2

6. **Main Entry Point**
   - Implement a functional `run_framework.py` script that can:
     - Parse command-line arguments
     - Initialize the `ConfigurationManager`
     - Create and initialize the `FrameworkController`
     - Exit gracefully if initialization fails

### 3.2 Non-Functional Requirements

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement robust error handling with specific exception types
   - Ensure graceful degradation for non-fatal errors
   - Provide clear, user-friendly error messages

3. **Logging**
   - Implement consistent logging with appropriate severity levels
   - Support configurable log levels via configuration file

4. **Security**
   - Securely handle API keys via environment variables
   - Implement safe path resolution for file operations
   - Validate configuration data to prevent injection attacks

5. **Documentation**

   - Integration tests for the initialization sequence

3. **Configuration Files**
   - Example YAML configuration file as per section 7.2 of the design

4. **Documentation**
   - Implementation notes and decisions
   - Updated/annotated design document if necessary

## 6. Testing Requirements

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Each class should have comprehensive unit tests

     - Configuration parsing
     - Component initialization
     - Error handling
     - Exception propagation

## 10. Additional Notes

- This RFI focuses solely on the core structure and initialization components (Phase 1.1)
- The actual message processing and interaction loop will be addressed in subsequent phases
- While implementing, consider the extensibility principles outlined in section 8 of the design
- The goal is to create a solid foundation that future phases can build upon

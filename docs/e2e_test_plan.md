# End-to-End Integration Test Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive test plan for Phase 3: End-to-End User Flow Tests for the KeystoneAI-Framework. These tests build upon the component-specific tests and controller integration tests to verify that the entire framework functions correctly with all components integrated together under realistic user scenarios.

## Test Categories

## Test Implementation Approach

### End-to-End Testing Framework

For end-to-end testing, we will use a combination of:

1. **Pytest fixtures** for setting up test environments
2. **Integration Test Case** class from utils.py for common assertions
3. **MockIOCapture** for simulating user inputs and capturing outputs
4. **MockLLMAdapter** configured with scenario-specific responses
5. **Python's unittest.mock** for mocking external dependencies
6. **pyfakefs** for simulating file operations

### Test Structure

Each test module will follow this structure:

```python
class TestE2EScenario(IntegrationTestCase):
    """Tests for specific end-to-end scenario."""
    
    def setup_method(self):
        """Set up test environment."""
        super().setup_method()
        # Additional scenario-specific setup
        
    def configure_mock_responses(self, mock_llm):
        """Configure mock LLM with scenario-specific responses."""
        # Configure LLM responses for this specific scenario
        
    def test_scenario_name(self, framework_controller_factory, mock_io_capture):
        """Test a specific scenario."""
        # 1. Setup (initialize controller, configure mocks)
        # 2. Exercise (simulate user inputs)
        # 3. Verify (assert expected outputs, message flow, etc.)
```

### Test Data

For realistic testing, we'll create:

1. **Mock project files** - Simulated code files for code-related scenarios
2. **Sample data files** - CSV, JSON, or other formats for data processing scenarios
3. **Conversation scripts** - Predefined conversation flows mimicking real usage

### Success Criteria

Tests will verify:

1. **Functional correctness** - Correct responses, tool execution, and command handling
2. **Flow integrity** - Proper message routing and context maintenance
3. **Error resilience** - Graceful handling of unexpected conditions
4. **User experience** - Appropriate feedback and engagement

## Test Coverage Goals

For end-to-end tests, we aim for:

1. **Scenario coverage** - Cover all identified user scenarios
2. **Component integration** - Exercise all framework components in integrated flows
3. **Edge case handling** - Verify behavior under unusual or unexpected conditions

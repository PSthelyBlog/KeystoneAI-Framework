# Request for Implementation: Framework Core Application Phase 2 Execution

**Date:** 2025-05-13  
**RFI ID:** RFI-COREAPP-IMPL-002-EXEC  
**Author:** Catalyst  
**Priority:** High  
**Related Documents:** 
- docs/coreapp_implementation_phase2_rfi.md
- docs/coreapp_implementation_plan_phase2.md

## 1. Overview

This Request for Implementation (RFI) tasks Forge with executing the implementation plan for Phase 2 of the Framework Core Application as detailed in the existing planning documents. Phase 2 builds upon the core structure established in Phase 1, focusing on the functional components necessary for handling message management, tool request processing, user interaction, and the main interaction loop.

The implementation should follow the detailed step-by-step plan provided in `docs/coreapp_implementation_plan_phase2.md`, which includes code templates, unit tests, and integration guidance.

## 2. Implementation Scope

Forge is requested to implement the following components according to the specifications and code templates provided in the implementation plan:

1. **Message Manager**
   - Implement conversation history maintenance
   - Support different message types (system, user, assistant, tool_result)
   - Implement history pruning strategies
   - Add serialization/deserialization for persistence

2. **Tool Request Handler**
   - Implement the interface between TEPS and the rest of the application
   - Add validation for tool requests
   - Support single and batch tool requests
   - Handle tool execution errors gracefully

3. **User Interface Manager**
   - Implement customizable input/output handling
   - Add support for ANSI color formatting
   - Support multi-line input and special commands

4. **Framework Controller Updates**
   - Implement the main interaction loop in the controller
   - Connect all components for seamless operation
   - Add special command processing
   - Implement graceful error handling

5. **Configuration and Sample Files**
   - Create configuration file templates
   - Implement sample context definitions

6. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update the README.md with Phase 2 components
   - Document the interaction patterns and special commands

7. **Integration Testing**
   - Implement tests to verify component integration
   - Ensure proper error handling across components

## 3. Implementation Approach

Forge should follow the seven-step implementation plan detailed in `docs/coreapp_implementation_plan_phase2.md`:

1. Step 1: Message Manager Implementation (code template provided)
2. Step 2: Tool Request Handler Implementation (code template provided)
3. Step 3: User Interface Manager Implementation (code template provided)
4. Step 4: Update Framework Controller with Main Interaction Loop (code template provided)
5. Step 5: Configuration and Sample Files
6. Step 6: Update Documentation
7. Step 7: Comprehensive Testing

Each step includes detailed code templates that should be implemented as provided, with modifications only where necessary to integrate with the existing codebase or to address unforeseen technical challenges.

## 4. Dependencies

- Phase 1 components (Framework Controller initialization, Configuration Manager, Component Managers, Error Handler)
- DCM component (implemented in previous RFI)
- LIAL component (implemented in previous RFI)
- TEPS component (implemented in previous RFI)

## 5. Adherence to AI-Assisted Dev Bible

This implementation must strictly adhere to the principles outlined in the AI-Assisted Dev Bible, with particular attention to:

- **Section 2: Security Considerations**
  - All user input must be validated
  - Tool requests must undergo validation before execution
  - Error messages should not expose sensitive information

- **Section 3: Testing Frameworks**
  - All components must have >85% test coverage
  - Both unit and integration tests must be implemented
  - Tests should verify both normal operation and error handling

- **Section 4: Documentation Practices**
  - All code must include comprehensive docstrings
  - Headers should include appropriate AI attribution
  - Inline comments should explain complex logic or design decisions

## 6. Deliverables

1. Implemented Python modules:
   - `framework_core/message_manager.py`
   - `framework_core/tool_request_handler.py`
   - `framework_core/ui_manager.py`
   - Updated `framework_core/controller.py`
   - Configuration and sample files

2. Unit and integration tests for all components

3. Updated documentation:
   - Updates to `README.md`
   - Code documentation (docstrings, comments)

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

The implementation will be considered complete when:

1. All components are implemented according to the specifications in the implementation plan
2. All unit and integration tests pass with >85% coverage
3. The Framework Core Application can initialize all components, process user input, execute tool requests, and maintain conversation history
4. Documentation is complete and up-to-date
5. All code adheres to the project's style guide and the AI-Assisted Dev Bible

## 8. Implementation Pre-Brief Request

Before beginning implementation, Forge is requested to provide an Implementation Pre-Brief outlining:

1. Understanding of the implementation requirements
2. Planned approach for each component
3. Any clarifications needed
4. Any anticipated challenges
5. Proposed timeline for implementation

This Pre-Brief will ensure alignment before implementation begins.

## 9. Additional Notes

- The implementation should prioritize correctness and robustness over optimization
- Follow the coding style established in Phase 1
- Where code templates need to be modified, document the reasons for deviation
- Upon completion, include a Task Completion Report outlining what was implemented, any challenges encountered, and any deviations from the plan with justification

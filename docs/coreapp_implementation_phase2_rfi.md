# Request for Implementation: Framework Core Application - Phase 2

**Date:** 2025-05-13  
**RFI ID:** RFI-COREAPP-IMPL-002  
**Author:** Catalyst  
**Priority:** High  
**Target Components:** Message Manager, Tool Request Handler, User Interface Manager

## 1. Overview

This Request for Implementation (RFI) outlines the requirements for Phase 2 of the Framework Core Application implementation. Building upon the core structure and initialization components implemented in Phase 1, this phase focuses on implementing the functional components necessary for handling message management, tool request processing, and user interaction.

Phase 2 will enable the Framework Core Application to:
- Maintain and manage conversation history
- Process and execute tool requests via TEPS
- Provide a user interface for interaction
- Establish the main interaction loop

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

- FR-IL-005: Implement graceful shutdown procedure

### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements

#### 2.2.1 Performance
- NFR-PERF-001: Message history pruning should execute in O(n) time
- NFR-PERF-002: Tool request handling should support asynchronous execution (future enhancement)
- NFR-PERF-003: UI operations should not block the main thread

#### 2.2.2 Security
- NFR-SEC-001: User input must be validated and sanitized
- NFR-SEC-002: Tool requests must be validated before execution
- NFR-SEC-003: Error messages should not expose sensitive information

#### 2.2.3 Maintainability
- NFR-MAINT-001: All classes should have comprehensive docstrings
- NFR-MAINT-002: Code should follow the project's style guide
- NFR-MAINT-003: Complex operations should be broken down into smaller methods

#### 2.2.4 Testing
- NFR-TEST-001: Achieve >85% test coverage for all new components
- NFR-TEST-002: Include unit tests for individual components
- NFR-TEST-003: Include integration tests for component interactions
- NFR-TEST-004: Include mock implementations for testing user interactions

## 3. Dependencies

### 3.1 Internal Dependencies
- Phase 1 implementation (Framework Controller, Configuration Manager, Component Managers, Error Handler)
- DCM component (implemented in previous RFI)
- LIAL component (implemented in previous RFI)
- TEPS component (implemented in previous RFI)

### 3.2 External Dependencies
- PyYAML (for configuration)
- No additional external dependencies anticipated for Phase 2

## 4. Constraints

- All implementation must follow the architecture defined in the design document
- The implementation must adhere to the AI Assisted Dev Bible principles (Section 2: Security, Section 3: Testing, Section 4: Documentation)
- Each component should have clearly defined interfaces to facilitate future extensions
- The implementation should be compatible with Python 3.9+

## 5. Deliverables

### 5.1 Code Deliverables
- MessageManager implementation (`framework_core/message_manager.py`)
- ToolRequestHandler implementation (`framework_core/tool_request_handler.py`)
- UserInterfaceManager implementation (`framework_core/ui_manager.py`)
- Updated FrameworkController with main interaction loop (`framework_core/controller.py`)
- Unit and integration tests for all components

### 5.2 Documentation Deliverables
- Updated README.md with Phase 2 components and usage
- Code comments and docstrings
- Example usage documentation

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

Phase 2 implementation will be considered complete when:

1. All functional and non-functional requirements have been implemented and verified
2. All unit and integration tests pass with >85% coverage
3. The Framework Core Application can:
   - Initialize all components successfully
   - Process user input and display assistant responses
   - Execute tool requests via TEPS
   - Maintain conversation history
   - Handle special commands
   - Perform graceful shutdown
4. All deliverables have been provided and reviewed
5. Code follows the project's style guide and adheres to the AI Assisted Dev Bible principles

## 7. Implementation Guidelines

### 7.1 Message Manager Implementation
- Follow the class structure defined in the architecture document
- Implement a configurable pruning strategy
- Support different message roles and formats
- Consider using a circular buffer for efficient history management

### 7.2 Tool Request Handler Implementation
- Implement robust validation before tool execution
- Use the TEPS manager for actual tool execution
- Handle different types of tool responses
- Implement proper error handling

### 7.3 User Interface Manager Implementation
- Use dependency injection for input/output handlers
- Support rich formatting using ANSI escape codes
- Implement configurable prompts and formatting
- Support multi-line input

### 7.4 Main Interaction Loop Implementation
- Ensure proper error handling throughout the loop

## 8. Additional Notes

- The implementation should focus on the core functionality first, followed by optimization
- Consider future extensibility in all implementations
- Document any deviations from the architecture design with justification
- The RFI for Phase 3 (which will focus on additional features and optimization) will be issued after completion of Phase 2

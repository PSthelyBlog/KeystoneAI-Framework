# Dynamic Persona Switching Implementation Summary

**RFI ID:** `RFI-COREAPP-FEATURE-DPS-001`  
**Feature:** Dynamic Persona Switching  
**Implemented by:** Forge  
**Date:** May 18, 2025

## Overview

This implementation adds the ability for users to dynamically switch between different AI personas (e.g., Catalyst, Forge) during a session via a special command. The feature allows for more flexible and context-aware interactions with the framework.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Changes to FrameworkController

- Added `active_persona_id` attribute to track the current active persona
- Modified `_setup_initial_context()` to set default persona from configuration
- Implemented `/persona` command handling in `_process_special_command()`
- Updated `_process_messages_with_llm()` to pass the active persona ID to LIAL

### 2. Changes to UIManager

- Added `set_assistant_prefix()` method to update the assistant prefix dynamically
- This allows the UI to reflect the currently active persona in the message prefix

### 3. Changes to ConfigurationManager

- Added `framework.default_persona` setting to configuration defaults
- Added `get_framework_settings()` method to access framework settings
- Updated default configuration to set "catalyst" as the default persona

### 4. Changes to config.yaml.example

- Added `default_persona` setting under the framework section
- Set default value to "catalyst"

### 5. Testing

- Added unit tests for all new functionality in FrameworkController
- Created integration tests to verify the persona switching flow end-to-end
- Tested persona validation against DCM-managed persona definitions

### 6. Documentation

- Updated USER_GUIDE.md to document the `/persona` command
- Updated DEVELOPER_GUIDE_V2.md with details about the persona switching architecture
- Added examples of extending the persona system

## Technical Decisions and Considerations

1. **Persona ID Validation**: The implementation validates that requested persona IDs exist in DCM before switching. This prevents users from switching to non-existent personas.

2. **UI Feedback**: The system provides clear feedback to users when switching personas, showing current persona when no parameter is provided, and error messages for invalid personas.

3. **Default Persona**: The default persona is configurable via `config.yaml`, with a fallback to "catalyst" if not specified.

4. **Performance Considerations**: Persona switching is a lightweight operation that only updates internal state and UI prefixes, making it near-instantaneous.

5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling ensures that the system continues to operate even if persona switching fails.

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to consider:

1. **Persona-Specific UI Styling**: Extend the UI to apply different colors or styles based on the active persona.

2. **Persona History**: Track the history of persona switches during a session for context awareness.

3. **Persona Permissions**: Implement a permission system that restricts certain personas from executing specific commands or tools.

4. **Persona Aliases**: Allow users to define aliases for personas (e.g., "c" for "catalyst").

5. **Contextual Persona Switching**: Implement context-aware persona switching that suggests or automatically switches personas based on the user's task.

## Conclusion

The dynamic persona switching feature enhances the framework's flexibility by allowing users to explicitly control which AI persona they are interacting with. This feature aligns with the framework's goal of providing a more natural and effective human-AI collaboration experience.

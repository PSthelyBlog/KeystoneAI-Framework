**Date:** 2025-05-14  
**Step:** 6 - Framework Core Application Integration Testing  
**Related RFI:** RFI-COREAPP-INT-TEST-001  

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the Framework Core Application. The integration tests are designed to verify that the different components of the framework work together as expected. This includes testing interactions between multiple components, verifying cross-component workflows, and ensuring proper end-to-end behavior.

## 2. Integration Test Scope

The scope of integration testing encompasses:

1. **Component Interface Compatibility**: Verifying that component interfaces correctly interact with one another.
2. **Data Flow**: Ensuring that data flows correctly between components.
3. **Error Handling**: Testing error propagation and recovery across component boundaries.
4. **End-to-End Workflows**: Testing complete workflow scenarios from user input to final output.
5. **Resource Management**: Ensuring resources are properly managed across component interactions.

## 3. Integration Test Approach

### 3.1. Test Environment

- **Testing Framework**: Python's unittest framework with unittest.mock for isolation
- **Test Coverage**: Aim for >80% integration coverage
- **Test Location**: Tests will be located in the `/tests/integration/` directory

### 3.2. Integration Test Types

#### 3.2.1. Component Chain Tests

Tests that verify chains of components work together correctly:

1. **DCM-LIAL-TEPS Chain**: Test the interaction between the Dynamic Context Manager, LLM Interaction Abstraction Layer, and Tool Execution & Permission Service.
2. **Message Manager-LIAL Integration**: Test that messages are correctly formatted and passed between the Message Manager and LIAL.
3. **UI Manager-Controller Integration**: Test that user input/output is correctly processed between the UI Manager and Controller.
4. **Tool Request Handler-TEPS Integration**: Test that tool requests are correctly processed and passed between the Tool Request Handler and TEPS.

#### 3.2.2. End-to-End Framework Tests

Tests that validate the entire framework working together:

1. **Complete Framework Initialization**: Test the initialization flow of all components.
2. **Message-Tool Request-Response Cycle**: Test the full cycle from user input to LLM response to tool execution and back.
3. **Configuration Loading and Component Setup**: Test that configuration is correctly loaded and applied to all components.
4. **Special Command Processing**: Test that special commands are correctly processed by the framework.

#### 3.2.3. Error Handling and Recovery Tests

Tests that verify the framework handles errors correctly:

1. **Component Initialization Failure**: Test recovery from component initialization failures.
2. **LLM Communication Failure**: Test recovery from LLM API failures.
3. **Tool Execution Failure**: Test recovery from tool execution failures.
4. **Invalid User Input**: Test handling of invalid user input.
5. **Invalid LLM Responses**: Test handling of unexpected LLM response formats.

## 4. Test Data and Mocking Strategy

### 4.1. Mock Components

The following components will be mocked for isolation:

1. **LLM Providers**: Mock the actual LLM API calls to provide controlled responses.
2. **File System**: Mock file system operations for deterministic testing.
3. **External Tools**: Mock external tool execution for controlled testing.
4. **User Input/Output**: Mock user interactions for automated testing.

### 4.2. Test Data

Test data will include:

1. **Sample Messages**: A set of sample messages representing various conversation states.
2. **Tool Request Templates**: Sample tool requests of various types.
3. **Configuration Scenarios**: Different configuration scenarios for testing.
4. **Mock LLM Responses**: Predetermined responses for different test scenarios.

  - Verbosity level (`--verbose` or `-v`)
  - Help information (`--help` or `-h`)

- FR-1.2: The application shall load and validate configuration from a YAML file (`framework_config.yaml`) with the following required parameters:
  - `llm_provider`: String identifying which LLM adapter to use
  - `context_definition_file`: Path to the `FRAMEWORK_CONTEXT.md` file
  
- FR-1.3: The application shall initialize the DCM component with the context definition file path from configuration.

- FR-1.4: The application shall initialize the appropriate LIAL adapter based on `llm_provider` configuration.

      "tool_call_id": Optional[str],  # For tool results
      "tool_name": Optional[str]  # For tool results
  }
  ```

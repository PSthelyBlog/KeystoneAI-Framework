3. Run coverage analysis after Phase 2 implementation
4. Proceed to Phase 3 with end-to-end user flow tests

## Current Test Coverage

Coverage assessment after completing Phase 1 (41 test cases):

- Overall coverage: 23% of framework_core (up from 15%)
- Component coverage highlights:
  - tool_request_handler.py: 98% coverage (up from 65%)
  - message_manager.py: 78% coverage (up from 0%)
  - lial_core.py: 93% coverage (unchanged)
  - lial_manager.py: 74% coverage (unchanged)
  - logging_utils.py: 72% coverage (unchanged)
  - dcm_manager.py: 28% coverage (unchanged)
  - teps_manager.py: 32% coverage (unchanged)
  - Components still at 0% coverage: controller.py, ui_manager.py, config_loader.py, dcm.py, error_handler.py, gemini_adapter.py

## Implementation Details

### DCM-LIAL Chain Tests

Successfully implemented in `/tests/integration/test_dcm_lial.py` with 8 test cases:
- LIAL initialization with DCM
- LIAL initialization failure handling
- Basic message flow
- Persona context application
- DCM document lookup functionality
- Error handling across the chain
- Tool request generation
- Message history processing

### LIAL-TEPS Chain Tests

Successfully implemented in `/tests/integration/test_lial_teps.py` with 7 test cases:
- Tool request generation from LIAL
- Tool execution by TEPS
- Tool result formatting
- Error handling in the LIAL-TEPS chain
- TEPS execution exception handling
- Full conversation flow with tool execution
- Handling multiple sequential tool requests

### Full DCM-LIAL-TEPS Chain Tests

Successfully implemented in `/tests/integration/test_dcm_lial_teps.py` with 5 test cases:
- End-to-end tool execution flow
- Persona-specific tool usage
- Multi-step workflow across all components
- Error propagation through the entire chain
- Context preservation in tool flow

### MessageManager Tests

Successfully implemented in `/tests/integration/test_message_manager.py` with 10 test cases:
- Adding different message types
- Message filtering by role
- LLM-specific message formatting
- History clearing with and without system message preservation
- Pruning strategies
- System message prioritization
- Full conversation flow
- Message count tracking
- Empty history handling
- Large message handling

### ToolRequestHandler Tests

Successfully implemented in `/tests/integration/test_tool_request_handler.py` with 11 test cases:
- Processing various tool types (readFile, writeFile, executeBashCommand)
- Error handling and propagation
- Request validation
- Batch processing of multiple tools
- Result formatting for message history
- Serialization failure handling
- Parameter validation
- Request ID handling

## Key Observations and Recommendations

1. **Testing Strategy Refinements**: Our testing approach evolved with each component:
   - For component chains: Direct response mapping with step counters proved most reliable
   - For MessageManager: Careful attention to pruning behavior required manual triggering
   - For ToolRequestHandler: Mock side_effect pattern worked well for validation testing

2. **Mocking Considerations**:
   - Using `side_effect` for complex mock behavior provides better testability than direct function assignment
   - For multi-step tests, explicitly resetting mocks between steps ensures clean state
   - Tracking call history is valuable for verifying complex interaction patterns

3. **Coverage Improvement Strategy**:
   - Phase 1 achieved strong coverage of core message processing and tool handling (78-98%)
   - Moderate coverage of manager components (28-74%)
   - Controller, UI, and concrete adapters remain untested (0%)

4. **Next Development Focus**:
   - Controller integration tests should leverage the framework_controller_factory fixture
   - Focus on initialization sequences, error handling across components
   - Special command processing (/help, /quit, etc.) is a key controller responsibility
   - Prepare for complex conversation flow simulations in Phase 3
